CS 370: Pirate Agent Project – Reflection
What I Did
In this project, I worked on creating a smart "pirate" that could move through a maze to find treasure. I was given some starter code that handled how the maze worked, but I had to write the part that taught the pirate how to learn and make good decisions. I used something called Q-learning, which is a method where the pirate learns by trying different paths and figuring out which ones lead to rewards.

What I Learned and Why It Matters
This class showed me how computers can "learn" by doing things over and over, and getting feedback each time. It’s kind of like how people get better at a game the more they play. We can train computers to act smarter by giving them points for doing the right thing and taking away points for mistakes.

Computer scientists help solve real-world problems by writing programs and systems that make things easier or smarter. Whether it's AI in a game or navigation in a car, these kinds of projects show how the skills I’m learning now can be used to build useful tools in everyday life.

How I Solve Problems as a Computer Scientist
When I run into a new challenge, I start by trying to understand the problem, then I make a plan, test it out, and keep improving it until I find what works best. For example, in this project, I had to adjust how much the pirate explored or how it remembered its past moves to help it get better results.

My Responsibility as a Developer
As someone who writes code and builds software, I need to think about how what I create affects people. Even if it’s just a simple game project, the same ideas can be used in real systems. That means I have to be careful to make things fair, clear, and safe for users — and always think about how my work might impact others.
